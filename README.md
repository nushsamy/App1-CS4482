## Tutorial Used: Create with Code
[Create With Code]https://learn.unity.com/course/create-with-code?uv=2019.4

## Modification
My modification is the addition of a sphere powerup that if the player touches it, destroys all the animals currently on the screen. I used rigidbodies and colliders as well as making use of the tags functionality in Unity to accomplish this.
